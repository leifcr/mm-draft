Change to states instead of true/false
E.g. a writer should be able to write, a proofreader should be able to update and a publisher should be able to publish
So it would be better to allow various states instead of published/not published

Move all drafts to be saved in separate collection, as the collection becomes a bit "bloated" by having duplicate of all records

Implement mm-tree again, however, the tree structure will be the "same" for drafts/non-drafts, as they will be in separate collections
Since mm-tree is using rational values for the tree structure it's easy to publish only certain tree elements
